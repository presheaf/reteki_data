    A zip files with all the images can be downloaded <b><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zP8cXBdYM7YgMYi7cGxpgIpx0IgqQrhy?usp=sharing">HERE</a></b>. The card images are named according to their NRDB card code, and are therefore sorted by release date. The files are sorted as follows:

   <p><i>unchanged</i> are cards which are not changed at all, <i>changed_deckbuilding</i> are cards which were changed, but only for the purposes of deck construction (influence, minimum deck size, limit 1 per deck), and <i>changed</i> are all other cards. Inside each folder, there are .zip files with names ending in <i>bleeds</i>" and </i>nonbleeds</i>. The bleed images have a colored border extending a little further than the regular card, and should be used if you plan on having the cards printed.

     <p>Finally, there is a separate folder "post_dnd_unofficial" holding card images for Mumbad, Flashpoint and Red Sands. A first pass of Reboot changes were made for them, but we have decided not to add them to the Reboot cardpool proper, so can't vouch for their balance. Still, feel free to print and play with them if you'd like.
     <p> (Note that the images have quite high resolution in the hopes that printing will look nicer, but if you plan to use them for anything else (e.g. displaying them on a page), you should convert them to JPEG first.)
