04029: A VoicePAD is a personal access device with most of its functions ripped out.
  Just about all it's good for is making voice-calls and managing your contacts. The

'04032': '"They call it ''retirement''. I call it ''euthanasia''." -Ken "Express"
  Tenma'
'04033': Writing a program that can pass the Turing test is easy. The Gibson-Akamatsu

'04043': '''Maneuver warfare'' is a doctrine that advocates keeping an enemy off-balance.
  It works just as well in cyberspace as in reality.'
'04045': Knowing is half the battle. The easy half, anyway.
'04046': With modern secretaries, incoming data can be filtered, sorted, tagged, and
  even sold without the intervention of a human user. In fact, given the zettabytes
  of data that might flood into a rig on a successful run, a human user could be considered
  useless ornamentation.
'04047': The core of the grid. A blinding sphere of light, teeming with energy, crackling
  with flame. Beyond were only twinkling bits of data in a field of darkness. No hacker
  dared approach the core, except one. He came back with a flare of code, a torch

  dark no more, and the legend of g00ru was born.
04048: Looks can be deceiving.

'04062': '"They call me a terrorist to scare people. If they want to find terrorists,
  maybe they should start by looking in the mirror." -Reina Roja'
'04063': Pros don't need to call their lawyer. Pros have their secretary rigged to

'04064': '"Care to have a look?"'
'04065': 'The first credited icebreaker was nothing more than a unique script to bypass
  the security calls on a Gibson 3 Data Sentry. Garrote has over 20,000 times the

'04071': As reported cases of brain damage in veterans rise, mind/machine interface
  devices are subject to increased public scrutiny. That certain programs can cause
  irreparable harm to users has gone from fringe theory to accepted truth.
'04072': The button didn't seem to do anything. So he pushed it again. And again.
  And again.
'04074': '"It''s ice so dangerous it has safety protocols. Think about that." -g00ru'
'04075': '"The damn raven just kind of cawed at me as I went past. I should have known

  immigrants with one parent, a discretionary income over 2k a month, B+ or higher
  grades, an outgoing personality, and have a friend who owns a g-monkey?"

  "Yes. Is that a problem?"

  "No, not at all. I just don''t get why your list is so short."'
'04077': "This ice disguises itself as a series of electronic transactions, tying\
  \ up the runner's funds in a thousand or so non-existent purchases and refunds.\
  \ The banks' system of holds and checks means that while not a single credit ever\

04081: 'That moment of bliss. That feeling of accomplishment. That certainty of purpose.

  What''s next?'
04082: Bleeding data is more of a science than an art. Too much and you can end up

04099: GRNDL refineries process many different rare elements unearthed during the
  fracking process.
'04103': The Dyson Fractal Generator is a useless lump of silicon; all it does is
  produce truly random results. What kind of madman slaps that in his rig? What's
  the use of a totally random number? -John Masanori
'04104': Take Moore's Law, iterate it over a century or two, and mix in quantum computing.
  You get to the point where you're developing the software on a hardware platform

  know you need it. My second favorite lady." -Gabriel Santiago'
'04106': There are good, honest, hardworking cops in the NAPD. Officers who do their

  was all an illusion, but it was a comforting illusion.
'05012': The Tenma clones became Jinteki's third highest-grossing line ever due to
  the rapid urban expansion that occurred after the war. Their unparalleled reaction
  times, safety records, and punctuality have made them the top choice for shipping

  \ his shuriken\u2026"
'05025': The annual review of ice as published by the NSCA consistently gives top

'05055': 'You can find Donut in the park on Thursday afternoons, playing backgammon.

'06010': On the first day She breathed data into the void, and it hung suspended like
  jewelled stars. On the second day She spoke order into the data, and it flowed from
